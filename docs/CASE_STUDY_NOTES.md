# Case Study Notes

This public repository is a sanitized demonstration of an LMS-style application.

Included:
- End-to-end leave workflow (employee, approver, admin)
- Role-based access controls
- Leave balance calculations
- Audit logging
- Optional SMTP notification flow

Removed for legal/privacy safety:
- Real credentials, secrets, certificates, and backup dumps
- Internal company documents and screenshots
- Real domains, inboxes, and organization-specific identifiers

If you present this in interviews, focus on:
- Problem framing and workflow design
- Tradeoffs made in schema/API/UI
- Security and data-handling decisions
- Testing strategy and future improvements
